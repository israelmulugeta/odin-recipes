            There perhaps has been no dish whose reputation has been laundered more effectively by a piece of fiction than the humble ratatouille — the roasted vegetable casserole that formed the centerpiece of arguably the best film centered around a cooking rodent, Pixar’s “Ratatouille.” If you somehow have managed to get this far in life without seeing the film, here is how it goes: At the film’s climax, notoriously vile food critic Anton Ego arrives to review the restaurant helmed by protagonist Remy (a rat of remarkable culinary acumen). But instead of giving the elitist Ego an outwardly sophisticated dish from the world of haute French cuisine, Remy opts for a different choice: the titular dish prepared confit byaldi style, with thin rounds of sliced tomato, zucchini and eggplant shingled atop a sauce of roasted red peppers, tomatoes, onion and garlic and then baked — the flavors of which, as it turns out, reminds Ego of his mother’s cooking, finally shattering his bitter, cold, critical veneer. 
        In the decade and a half since the film`s release, ratatouille, once a modest commoner’s meal, has risen to fame as a popular statement dish — and why wouldn’t it be? It’s gorgeous, with cascading, multicolored stripes circling its baking dish and an apparent delicateness when placed upon the plate with a spoonful of brilliant orange sauce encircling it. Ratatouille is a feast.
