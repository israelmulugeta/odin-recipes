        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            There perhaps has been no dish whose reputation has been laundered more effectively by a piece of fiction than the humble ratatouille — the roasted vegetable casserole that formed the centerpiece of arguably the best film centered around a cooking rodent, Pixar’s “Ratatouille.” If you somehow have managed to get this far in life without seeing the film, here is how it goes: At the film’s climax, notoriously vile food critic Anton Ego arrives to review the restaurant helmed by protagonist Remy (a rat of remarkable culinary acumen). But instead of giving the elitist Ego an outwardly sophisticated dish from the world of haute French cuisine, Remy opts for a different choice: the titular dish prepared confit byaldi style, with thin rounds of sliced tomato, zucchini and eggplant shingled atop a sauce of roasted red peppers, tomatoes, onion and garlic and then baked — the flavors of which, as it turns out, reminds Ego of his mother’s cooking, finally shattering his bitter, cold, critical veneer. 
        In the decade and a half since the film`s release, ratatouille, once a modest commoner’s meal, has risen to fame as a popular statement dish — and why wouldn’t it be? It’s gorgeous, with cascading, multicolored stripes circling its baking dish and an apparent delicateness when placed upon the plate with a spoonful of brilliant orange sauce encircling it. Ratatouille is a feast.

           <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, from 8-10 leaves</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons Chopped fresh parsley</li>

        <h2>steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven for 375˚F (190˚C).</li>
            <li>Slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1-mm) rounds, then set asid</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Arrange the sliced veggies in alternating patterns, (for example, eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce from the outer edge to the middle of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.</li>
            <li>Serve while hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also excellent the next day--cover with foil and reheat in a 350˚F (180˚C) oven for 15 minutes, or simply microwave to desired temperature.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Enjoy!</em></strong></li>
        </ol>
