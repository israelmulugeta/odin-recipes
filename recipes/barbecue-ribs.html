    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
   <p>Ribs are simply a barbecue favorite. They are the perfect messy food, and if cooked and seasoned to perfection, ribs are nearly impossible to resist.
    Obviously, what we love the most about ribs is their delicious taste. Itâ€™s all about the juicy, perfectly seasoned, and tender barbecue flavor. But, we also love that ribs are the perfect meal to enjoy with family and friends on any occasion. Celebrations and parties for graduations, holidays, and promotions are always enhanced with the great taste of prime rib. And, whether you are cooking your own ribs at home or enjoying a night out at your local barbecue joint, ribs are a decadent delight.

        <li>Combine the brown sugar, chili powder, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, the oregano, cayenne, garlic powder and onion powder in a small bowl and rub the mixture on both sides of the ribs. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. In a roasting pan, combine the broth and vinegar. Add the ribs to the pan. Cover with foil and tightly seal. Bake 2 hours. Remove the ribs from the pan and place them on a platter. Pour the liquid from the pan into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. Add the barbecue sauce.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to medium high. Put the ribs on the grill and cook about 5 minutes on each side, until browned and slightly charred. Cut the ribs between the bones and toss them in a large bowl with the sauce. Serve hot.</li>
