    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
   <p>Ribs are simply a barbecue favorite. They are the perfect messy food, and if cooked and seasoned to perfection, ribs are nearly impossible to resist.
    Obviously, what we love the most about ribs is their delicious taste. Itâ€™s all about the juicy, perfectly seasoned, and tender barbecue flavor. But, we also love that ribs are the perfect meal to enjoy with family and friends on any occasion. Celebrations and parties for graduations, holidays, and promotions are always enhanced with the great taste of prime rib. And, whether you are cooking your own ribs at home or enjoying a night out at your local barbecue joint, ribs are a decadent delight.
