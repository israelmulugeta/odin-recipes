        <p>Doro wat (also spelled doro wot) is an Ethiopian chicken stew flavored with a spiced butter called niter kibbeh and berbere, a spice blend that often includes fenugreek, hot chiles, paprika, cardamom, and coriander. Toward the end of cooking, hard-boiled eggs are added to the stew. Doro wat is typically served with injera bread, a flatbread made with teff, the staple grain of Ethiopia. It's one of the most recognizable Ethiopian foods and is served in Ethiopian restaurants around the world.</p>
