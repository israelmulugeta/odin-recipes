        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Chinese fried rice is the quintessential comfort food. Think of itâ€”a bowl of steaming white rice cooked to just the right consistency, filled with bits of meat and vegetable. No wonder fried rice is one of the world's most popular rice dishes!
            For the home cook, the beauty of fried rice is that it is very adaptable. Like chow mein, it's perfect for those nights when you're cleaning out the refrigerator and want to get rid of any leftover meat or vegetables.
